\subsection{Initialising a decelerated bunch}
-Compare to actual already propagated bunch we want to simulate. See how quickly the uniform plasma resembles that of the plasma of the propagated simulation. If it takes long time then the laser results might not represent the real situation.  Compare simulations side by side as both real and initialised bunches propagate further, see if any deviations occur or if the bunch I set up is actually a fair approximation (compare energy, particle number etc.)
\subsection{Introduction of co-propagating laser}
- Results with respect to laser intensity/amplitude/wavelength as well as distance from bunch.
