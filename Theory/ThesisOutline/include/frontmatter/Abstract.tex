\section*{Abstract}
This report presents an account of the preliminary research performed during the first semester of a master's project on plasma-based deceleration techniques for the disposal of ultra-relativistic electron beams. These plasma beam dumps are able to generate decelerating electric fields fields on the order of GV/m through the generation of plasma wakefields, with the potential to provide a cheaper, safer and more compact alternative to conventional beam dumps. The primary aim of this full-year project is to demonstrate, through Particle-In-Cell plasma simulations, the full energy depletion of a 1 GeV electron bunch. Particular focus is on extending the active beam-dump scheme; in which a decelerating wakefield is generated by driving a laser pulse ahead of the electron bunch through a plasma. This intermediate report provides the theoretical background of plasma wakefields and establishes the computational framework necessary to perform these studies.
