\section{Introduction}
In this chapter we introduce the linear fluid model of plasma wakefield acceleration and derive the equations governing the response of a plasma to an electron bunch propagating through. This model assumes that the bunch is ultra-relativistic and that the plasma density is much higher than the bunch density, which will allow us to treat the plasma response as a first order perturbation to the background density.  We also discuss the non-linear, so-called "blowout", regime which can not be treated perturbatively and is characterised by the expulsion of plasma electrons in a volume behind the bunch. 
\section{Linear fluid model }
In this section, we derive the response of a plasma to an electron bunch by considering the plasma electrons as a fluid. We shall make the assumptions;  (i) the initial plasma is uniform and electrically neutral everywhere; (ii) the plasma  ions can be considered stationary since for all plasmas the mass of the ions is much larger than the electron mass, $m_{\text{ion}}>>m_{e}$; (iii) the electron bunch is ultra-relativistic, $v/c=1$, such that the density distribution of the bunch does not evolve as it interacts with the plasma; (iv) the bunch density is much less than the plasma electron density, $n_b<<n_p$. The dynamics of the plasma electrons is governed by the continuity equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial n_p}{\partial t}=-\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot (n_p\vec{v}_p)
\end{equation}
where $n_p$ is the plasma electron density density and $\vec{v}_p$ the plasma fluid velocity. This simply ensures charge conservation by imposing that the plasma electron density change in a given volume is due to plasma electrons flowing in or out. The evolution of the electromagnetic fields in the plasma is governed by Maxwell's laws:
\begin{align}
&\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \vec{E}=-\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \\
&\boldsymbol{\nabla}\times \vec{B}=\frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{J}+\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}
\end{align}
which in term determine the response of the plasma fluid through the Lorentz force law:
\begin{equation}
m_e\frac{\partial n_p\vec{v}_p}{\partial t}=en_p\left(\vec{E}+\frac{\vec{v}_p\times \vec{B}}{c}\right)~.
\end{equation}
We now make use of assumption (iv)
which allows us to treat the plasma response to a particle beam perturbatively such that  $n_p=n_0+n_1$, where $n_0$ is the unperturbed uniform electron density and $n_1\ll n_0$ is the perturbation from interacting with the electron bunch. This perturbation also requires that the change in fluid velocity upon interacting with the bunch is small, such that $v_p\ll c$. Substitution into the continuity equation yields 

%Treating the plasma response to a particle beam perturbatively we have $n(r,z,t)=n_0+n_1(r,z,t)$ where $n_0$ is the ion density and $n_1$ the plasma perturbation. We let $\vec{v}, \vec{E}, \vec{B}$ be perturbative responses to the beam. From continuity equation we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial n_1}{\partial t}= -n_0\left( 1- \frac{n_1}{n_0}\right)\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot \vec{v}_p
\end{equation}
Taking the time differential and neglecting terms $\mathcal{O}(n_1/n_0)$ then gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 n_1}{\partial t^2}= -n_0\frac{\partial (\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v})}{\partial t}
\label{n''}
\end{equation}
Similarly, substitution into the Lorentz force law gives to first-order
\begin{equation}
 m_e\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t}= e\vec{E}
\end{equation} %m_en_0\frac{\partial (1+n_1/n_0)\vec{v}}{\partial t}\approx en_0(1+n_1/n_0)\vec{E} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 
which, using Gauss's law, gives
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\vec{v})}{\partial t}= \frac{e^2}{m_e}4\pi (n_1+n_b)
\label{n''2}
\end{equation}
where $n_b$ is the charge density of the electron bunch. Equations (\ref{n''}) and (\ref{n''2}) hence give
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 n_1}{\partial t^2}+\omega_p^2n_1=-\omega_p^2n_b
\label{ndotdot}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_p=(4\pi e^2n_0/m_e)^{1/2}$ is the plasma frequency. Hence the plasma density perturbation is described by a second-order differential equation with the bunch acting as a source term. We proceed to solve this for a radially symmetric bunch by evaluating equation (\ref{ndotdot}) in a reference frame co-moving with the electron bunch, where the coordinate $\xi=x-ct$ represents the position along the bunch as it travels in the $x$-direction. Doing this yields
\begin{equation}
-\frac{1}{k_p^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial \xi^2}+k_p^2\right)n_1\left(r,\xi \right)=n_b\left(r,\xi \right) 
\end{equation}
where $k_p=\omega_p/c$ is the wavenumber and causality demands that $n_1\left(r,\xi<0 \right)=0$. We evaluate this by finding the Green's function $G\left(\xi,\xi'\right)$, which by definition obeys 
\begin{equation}
-\frac{1}{k_p^2}\left(\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial \xi^2}+k_p^2\right)G\left(\xi,\xi'\right)=\delta\left(\xi-\xi'\right)
\label{density_greens}
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
G\left(\xi,\xi'\right)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0 &,~ -\infty<\xi<\xi'\\
A(\xi')\sin\left(k_p\xi \right) + B(\xi')\cos\left(k_p\xi \right) &,~ \xi'<\xi<\infty
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
where  the constant $A(\xi')$ and $B(\xi')$ are determined by by requiring continuity at $\xi=\xi'$ and by integrating equation (\ref{density_greens}) across this same boundary. This yields 
\begin{equation}
G\left(\xi,\xi'\right)=k_p\Theta(\xi-\xi')\left(\cos(k_p\xi)\sin(k_p\xi')-\cos(k_p\xi')\sin(k_p\xi)\right)
\end{equation}
and the resulting plasma perturbation is
%\begin{equation}
%\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{\xi'-\epsilon}^{\xi'+\epsilon} \mathcal{L}_{\xi}G\left(\xi,\xi'\right)\mathrm{d}\xi=\lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{\xi'-\epsilon}^{\xi'+\epsilon}\delta\left(\xi\right)\mathrm{d}\xi=1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\left[-\frac{1}{k_p^2}\frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi}\right]^{\xi'+\epsilon}_{\xi'-\epsilon}=1
%\end{equation}
%Without loss of generality we may set the arrival of the beam to be at $t=0$, such that $\xi'=0$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
n_1\left(r,\xi \right)&=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}G\left(\xi,\xi'\right)n_b\left(r,\xi' \right) \mathrm{d}\xi'\\
&=\int_{-\infty}^{\xi}\sin\left(k_p(\xi-\xi')\right)n_b\left(r,\xi' \right) \mathrm{d}\xi'
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where we have used the trigonometric identify for $\sin\left(k_p(\xi-\xi'\right))$. Hence the electron bunch induces oscillatory density perturbations in the plasma with a wavelength given by $\lambda_p=2\pi/k_p$.
\subsection{Longitudinal Accelerating Field} 

gives
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\vec{E}-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 \vec{E}}{\partial t^2}=\frac{4\pi}{c^2}\frac{\partial \vec{J}}{\partial t}+4\pi\boldsymbol{\nabla}\rho
\end{equation}
Lorentz for law ($\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the plasma):
\begin{equation}
m\frac{\partial n\vec{v}}{\partial t}=en\left(\vec{E}+\frac{\vec{v}\times\vec{B}}{c} \right)\approx en\vec{E} \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{\partial \vec{J}_p}{\partial t}=\frac{e^2 n}{m}\vec{E}
\end{equation}
Letting $\rho=\rho_b+\rho_p$ and $\vec{J}=\vec{J}_b+\vec{J}_p$ for the beam and plasma respectively, and $\vec{J}_b=c\rho_b\hat{\vec{z}}$, gives
\begin{equation}
\left(\nabla^2-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-k_p^2\right)\vec{E}=\frac{4\pi}{c}\frac{\partial \rho_b}{\partial t}\hat{\vec{z}}+4\pi\boldsymbol{\nabla}\left(\rho_b+\rho_p\right)
\end{equation}
where $k_p=\omega_p/c$ is the plasma wave number. To find the electric field along the beam, z-direction, we proceed by solving
\begin{equation}
\left(\nabla^2-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}-k_p^2\right)E_z=\frac{4\pi}{c}\frac{\partial \rho_b}{\partial t}+4\pi\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\rho_b+\rho_p\right)
\end{equation}
using $\nabla^2=\nabla^2_{\perp}+\partial^2_z$, in Fourier transform space, where\\
\textcolor{purple}{change this to E=integral tilde E, then substitute that into the following equations, since the RHS of 2.14 is not correct, fourier transform of the derivative acting on the function is not the same as the derivative acting on the transformed function}
\begin{equation}
E_z(\xi)\left(k\right)=\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty}\wtilde{E}_z(k)e^{ik\xi}\mathrm{d}k~~,~~~\left(\rho_b(k)+\rho_b(k)\right)=\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\wtilde{\rho}_b\left(\xi\right)+\wtilde{\rho}_p\right)\left(\xi\right)e^{ik\xi}\mathrm{d}\xi
\end{equation}
such that 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial z^2}-\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2}\right)E_z(\xi)=0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{4\pi}{c}\frac{\partial {\rho}_b}{\partial t}+4\pi\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\left({\rho}_b+{\rho}_p\right)=-4\pi i k\wtilde{\rho}_b+4i k\pi\wtilde{\rho}_b+4i k\pi\wtilde{\rho}_p=4i k\pi\wtilde{\rho}_p
\end{equation}
which gives 
\begin{equation}
\left(\nabla^2_{\perp}-k^2_p\right)\wtilde{E}_z\left(\xi\right)=4\pi i k\wtilde{\rho}_p
\end{equation}
We note that the two contributions from the beam cancel each other out, this is because of relativistic effects (?) \citep{Gessner2016}.
From eq. XXX we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2{\rho}_p}{\partial t^2}+\omega_p^2{\rho}_p=-\omega_p^2{\rho}_b \quad \Rightarrow\quad
-k^2\wtilde{\rho}_p+k_p^2\wtilde{\rho}_p=-k_p^2\wtilde{\rho}_b \quad \Rightarrow\quad \wtilde{\rho}_p=\frac{k_p^2}{k^2-k_p^2}\wtilde{\rho}_b
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\perp}^2=\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial }{\partial r}r\frac{\partial }{\partial r} +\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial \phi^2} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \left(\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial }{\partial r} -k^2_p\right)\wtilde{E}_z
=4\pi ik_p^2 \frac{k}{k^2-k_p^2}\wtilde{\rho}_b
\label{diffeq_in_transformspace}
\end{equation}
We now rewrite this equation as
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}\wtilde{E}_z= \wtilde{f}(r)
\end{equation}
We proceed as before and solve this PDE by finding the Green's function. Working in a cylindrical coordinate system we have that the Green's function must satisfy 
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}G(\vec{r},\vec{r}')=\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r}')=\frac{1}{r}\delta(r-r')\delta(\phi-\phi')\delta(z-z')
\end{equation}
where the RHS is the 3D Dirac delta function in cylindrical polar coordinates, defined such that 
$\int\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r}')r\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\phi\mathrm{d}z=1$. Letting 
\begin{equation}
G(\vec{r},\vec{r}')=G_r(r,r')\delta(\phi-\phi')\delta(z-z')
\end{equation}
leads to 
\begin{equation}
\mathscr{L}G_r(r,r')=\frac{1}{r}\delta(r-r')
\end{equation}
The LHS of this expression is the modified Bessel function of order zero and the RHS represents our source term. Consequently the Green's function is formed by linear combinations of, the linearly independent, modified Bessels functions of order zero. \todo{Standard Bessel function with complex arguments}
\begin{equation}
G\left(r,r'\right)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
A(r')(A_1 I_0(k_pr)+B_1K_0(k_pr)) &,~ 0<r<r'\\
B(r')(A_2 I_0(k_pr)+B_2K_0(k_pr))  &,~ r'<r<\infty
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
requiring that the two parts of this expression each satisfy one of the B.Cs we have that $B_1=A_2=0$ since $K_0(k_pr)\to \infty$ as $r\to 0$ and $I_0(k_pr)\to \infty$ as $r\to \infty$. Continuity in $G(r,r')$ at $r=r'$ further gives that 
\begin{equation}
G\left(r,r'\right)=A_0\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
I_0(k_pr)K_0(k_pr') &,~ 0<r<r'\\
I_0(k_pr')K_0(k_pr)  &,~ r'<r<\infty
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
where $A_0$ is a constant of proportionality that we find by integrating $\mathscr{L}G(r,r')=\delta(r-r')/r$ with respect to $r$ across the interval $\left[r'-\epsilon, r'+\epsilon \right]$, which needs to be satisfied for all $\epsilon$, including the limit as $\epsilon\to 0$.
\begin{align}
 \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{r'-\epsilon}^{r'+\epsilon}\left(\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial G}{\partial r} -k^2_pG\right)\mathrm{d}r= \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\int_{r'-\epsilon}^{r'+\epsilon}\frac{1}{r}\delta(r-r')\mathrm{d}r&=\frac{1}{r'}\\
 \lim_{\epsilon\to 0}\Big[\frac{1}{k_p}\frac{\partial G}{\partial r} \Big]_{z-\epsilon}^{z+\epsilon}=\frac{A_0}{k_p} \left.\left(I_0(k_pr')\frac{\partial K_0(k_pr)}{\partial r}-\frac{\partial I_0(k_pr)}{\partial r}K_0(k_pr')\right)\right|_{r=r'} &=\frac{1}{r'}
\end{align}
\todo{find missing minus sign, check if a green's function can have r' in front, see judith's notes for what the constant of proportionality should be.}
This equality must hold for all values of $r'$. Hence, following an approach by Jackson \citep{Jackson1962}, we evaluate the LHS for $r'\gg 1$, where $I_0$ and $K_0$ take the limiting forms 
\begin{equation}
I_0(k_pr')\to \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi k_pr'}}e^{k_pr'} \quad \text{and} \quad K_0(k_pr')\to \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2k_pr'}}e^{-k_pr'}
\end{equation}
which implies that $A_0=-1$. %\textcolor{purple}{Here Gessner gets $A=4\pi$ because of Jackson but I don't see why.} 
\begin{equation}
G\left(r,r'\right)=- I_0(k_pr)K_0(k_pr')\Theta(r'-r)-I_0(k_pr')K_0(k_pr)\Theta(r-r')
\end{equation}
We can thus find $\wtilde{E}_z$ from 
\begin{equation}
\wtilde{E}_z(r,k)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}G\left(r,r'\right)f(r',k)r'\mathrm{d}r'
\end{equation}
and then perform an inverse Fourier transform to find 
\begin{equation}
E_z(r,\xi)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty}\wtilde{E}_z\left(r,k\right)e^{ik\xi}\mathrm{d}\xi
\end{equation}
Doing this yields 
\begin{align}
E_z(r,\xi)&=-{2ik_p^2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{ke^{ik\xi}}{k^2-k_p^2}\mathrm{d}k\int_0^{\infty}\left( I_0(k_pr)K_0(k_pr')\Theta(r'-r)+I_0(k_pr')K_0(k_pr)\Theta(r-r') \right)\wtilde{\rho}_b(r')r'\mathrm{d}r'
\label{e_z}
\end{align}
For a known beam distribution $rho_b(r,\xi)$ (add $\xi$ in all previous expressions?) this expression can be used to compute the resulting longitudinal electric field. We shall now proceed by calculating this for a bi-Gaussian bunch distribution. To do this, we could compute the electric field from the Green's function directly and then carrying out the inverse Fourier transform, or we could choose to first compute the field due to a point-particle and then convolving it with the bi-Gaussian distribution. We proceed by doing the latter by following the approach of Dawson; we choose a charge distribution with radial symmetry and a delta function in the $z$-direction to match our Green's function.
\begin{align}
{\rho}_{b_0}(r,\xi)=\frac{e}{2\pi r}\delta(r-r_0)\delta(\xi) \quad \Rightarrow\quad  \wtilde{\rho}_{b_0}(r,k)=\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty}\rho_b(r,\xi)e^{-ik\xi}\mathrm{d}\xi=\frac{e}{2\pi r}\delta(r-r_0)
\end{align}
Substituing this into equation (\ref{e_z}) and performing a contour integrating in k-space yields 
\begin{equation}
E_z(r,\xi)=-2ek_p^2\cos(k_p\xi)G\left(r,r_0\right)\Theta(\xi)~,
\label{singe-particle-wake}
\end{equation}
where $\Theta(\xi)$ ensures causality is preserved. This is the so called single-particle wake function [Dawson]. The longitudinal electric field resulting from an arbitrary radially-symmetric source distribution $n_b(r,\xi)$ is now given by convolving the source by the single-particle wake function:
%\begin{equation}
%\wtilde{E}_z(r,k)=-2eik_p^2\frac{k}{k^2-k_p2}G\left(r,r_0\right)
%\end{equation}
%which satisfies (\ref{diffeq_in_transformspace}), as can be shown by integrating across the discontinuity and taking the limit to zero, and then gives

%\textcolor{red}{But my Green's function has a $A=-1$ as constant and not $A=4\pi$ as Bonatto and Gessner}\\
%This is refer to as the single-particle wake function \citep{Gessner2016}. 
\begin{align}
E_z(r,\xi)&=-2ek_p^2\int_0^{2\pi}\mathrm{d}\phi  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cos(k_p(\xi-\xi'))\Theta(\xi-\xi')\mathrm{d}\xi' \int_{0}^{\infty}G\left(r,r_0\right) n_b(r_0,\xi')r'\mathrm{d}r'\\
&=-4\pi e k_p^2 \int_{-\infty}^{\xi} \cos(k_p(\xi-\xi'))\mathrm{d}\xi' \int_{0}^{\infty}G\left(r,r_0\right) n_b(r_0,\xi')r_0\mathrm{d}r_0
\end{align}
The electric force is thus $F_z(r,\xi)=-eE_z(r,\xi)$. To compare with simulations and experiments we now choose to convert from CGS to SI units by having $e^{\text{CGS}}\to e^{SI}/\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_0}$. The electric force in SI units (J/m) is thus
\begin{equation}
F_z(r,\xi)=\frac{e^2 k_p^2}{\epsilon_0} \int_{-\infty}^{\xi} \cos(k_p(\xi-\xi'))\mathrm{d}\xi' \int_{0}^{\infty}G\left(r,r_0\right) n_b(r_0,\xi')r_0\mathrm{d}r_0
\end{equation}
This expression can be calculated numerically to ; fig. \ref{ex}

\subsection{Transverse Focusing Field} 
An ultrarelativisitic electron bunch will be highly contracted in the direction of propagation relative to the plasma electrons in the 'lab' frame. Assuming $\beta=1$ as before the electric field due to the bunch is purely radial, $E_r$. In addition, the magnetic field due to the charge is azimuthal, $B_{\theta}$. The resulting transverse wakefield $W_{\perp}=E_r-B_{\theta}$ experienced by a realtivisit particle due to the wake is given by the \textit{Panofsky-Wenzel theorem}, which says that the transverse wakefield at a position $\xi$ behind the head of the bunch is related to the longtiduinal wakefield $W_{\parallel}$ via
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial W_{\perp} }{\partial \xi}=\frac{\partial W_{\parallel} }{\partial r}~.
\end{equation} 
Since $W_{\parallel} =E_z$ this gives a transverse wakefield
\begin{equation}
W_{\perp}(\xi)=\int \frac{\partial W_{\parallel} }{\partial r}\mathrm{d}\xi~.
\end{equation}
The transverse force on a bi-Gaussian bunch can now by found by applying this expression to on the longitudinal single-particle wakefield (\ref{singe-particle-wake}) and then performing the same convolution as above, which yields 
\begin{equation}
F_r(r,\xi)=\frac{e^2 k_p^2}{\epsilon_0} \int_{-\infty}^{\xi} \sin(k_p(\xi-\xi'))\mathrm{d}\xi' \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k_p}\frac{\partial G\left(r,r_0\right)}{\partial r}  n_b(r_0,\xi')r_0\mathrm{d}r_0
\end{equation}

\section{Non-linear Regime} 
\subsection{Wave-breaking field}
\underline{Dawson's derivation} [Note: The wave-breaking field does not represent the onset of the non-linear regime but the highest achievable field in the non-linear regime.]
We consider a simple 1D linear non-relativistic electron sheet model first used by Dawson \citep{Dawson1959} to show the breakdown of the linear model (\textcolor{red}{correct?}). Consider the plasma being made up of thin sheets of ions and electrons. A sheet at equilibrium position $z=z_0$ is then displaced by $\eta_0(z_0)$, where the displacement is set as function of the equilibrium position for full generality, to a new position $z=z_0+\eta_0$. The displaced sheet reveals a positive surface charge density $\sigma=en_0\eta_0$, where $n_0$ is the electron charge density in the plasma. This sets up a restoring electric field which we find using Gauss's law to be $E_{\text{res}}=4\pi n_0e\eta_0$ which yields a restoring force
\begin{equation}
 m_e\frac{\partial^2\eta_0}{\partial t^2}=-eE_{\text{res}}=-4\pi n_0e^2\eta_0=-\omega_p^2\eta_0
 \end{equation} 
 with solutions 
 \begin{equation}
 \eta_0(z_0,t)=A_1(z_0)\cos(\omega_p t)+A_2(z_0)\sin(\omega_p t)
 \end{equation}
The phenomena of wave breaking can be shown by considering another electron sheet at an equilibrium position $z_1=z_0+\Delta z_0$ at a distance $\Delta z_0$ away from the first sheet. This sheet is then displaced by $\eta_1$ to a new position $z^{*}_1=z_0+\Delta z_0+\eta_1$. The linear model is valid provided that there are no electron trajectories intersect one another in the plasma [ \textcolor{red}{is this correct? Why does the model break down?} ]. Hence the model is valid provided that $z^{*}_1-z_0>z-z_0$ which implies that we must have
\begin{equation}
\Delta z_0+\eta_1>\eta_0~,
\label{eta_ineq}
\end{equation}
for all $\Delta z_0\in \mathbb{R}$, to sustain plasma oscillations in the linear model. We now consider  the limit as $\Delta z_0\to 0$ for the expression 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x_0}=\lim_{\Delta z_0\to 0}\frac{\Delta \eta}{\Delta z_0}=\lim_{\Delta z_0\to 0}\left(\frac{\eta_1-\eta_0}{\Delta z_0}\right)>\lim_{\Delta z_0\to 0}\left(\frac{\eta_0-\Delta z_0-\eta_0}{\Delta z_0}\right)=-1
\end{equation}
which simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z_0}>-1
\label{no_crossing}
\end{equation}
where the inequality is introduced using Eq. (\ref{eta_ineq}). We now consider the special case where $A_1(z_0)=A\sin(k_pz_0)$ and $A_2(z_0)=0$. This is a valid solution since $\sin(k_pz_0)$ is single-valued for all $k_p,x_0\in\mathbb{R}$. This particular solution is chosen to highlight the breadown of the electric field, and is motivated by ([\textcolor{red}{what?}]) the solution we found for the electric field in section 2. Applying the no-crossing criterion in Eq. \ref{no_crossing} to $\eta=\eta_0(z_0,t)$ yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \eta_0}{\partial z_0}=Ak_p\cos(k_pz_0)>-1 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad Ak_p\leq 1
\end{equation}
which gives the maximum amplitude as $A_{max}=1/k_p$. Hence the maximum restoring electric field $E_{max}\equiv E_{\text{wb}}=4\pi n_0/k_p$ is given by
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{wb}}=\frac{m_ev_p\omega_p}{e}
\end{equation}
the so-called \textit{wave-breaking field}. To further show how this breaks the linear model we consider the effect on the electric field up to and past the wave-breaking limit. As above we have, 
\begin{equation}
z=z_0+\eta_0=z_0+A\sin(k_p z_0)
\label{dawson_z}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
E=4\pi n_0e A\sin(k_p z_0)
\label{dawson_E(z)}
\end{equation}
from which we want to find the electric field as a function of $z$. We can do this by numerically solving Eq. \ref{dawson_z} for $z_0$ in a range of $z$ values given fixed values of $A$. The gives $z_0=z_0(z,A)$ which can be substituted into Eq. \ref{dawson_E(z)} to give $E=E(z,A)$, the result of which is shown in Fig. \ref{DawsonCriterionPlot}. From this we conclude that the electric field is no longer single-valued for $A>1/k_p$, i.e past the electric field's wave-breaking amplitude, which signifies a breakdown of the linear model.\\
This is further emphasized by consider the electron-density response as $\partial \eta/\partial z_0\to -1$. To do this we use  Eq. XXX in 1D with no beam density $n_b=0$, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial z}=4\pi e(n_0-n)
\end{equation}
where $n=n_0+n_1$ is the perturbed plasma density and $n_0$ is the ion density, hence $n_0-n$ is the free (negative) charge density in the plasma. We now take the derivative of the perturbed electric field and substitute the above expression
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial E}{\partial z}=4\pi n_0 e \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z} \quad \Rightarrow \quad n=n_0\left(1-\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z}\right)
\end{equation}
We now rewrite $\partial /\partial z$, using $z=z_0+\eta$, as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=\left(1-\frac{\partial \eta }{\partial z_0}\right)^{-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_0}
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
n=\frac{n_0}{1+\frac{\partial \eta }{\partial z_0}}
 \end{equation} 
 which means that the perturbed electron density grows infinite as $\partial \eta/\partial z_0\to -1$, again signifying the breakdown of the linear model.\\

Having seen that the linear theory can break down mathematically, it is crucial to ask whether this is realised in 3D models and experiments as well.

What is the wave-breaking electric field?



\subsection{Collective Plasma Deceleration -- Linear regime }
Based on the work of Lu et. al \citep{Lu2006}, wherein it was shown that the predictions from the linear models perform well even in the non-linear regime, it is of interest to compute the energy loss in the linear regime. This follows the analysis by Bonatto et al. \citep{Bonatto2016}.\\
The energy loss of a bunch is due to the work carried out by the longitudinal electric field $E_z$, neglecting effects such as bremsstralung etc. The rate of energy change with propagation distance of a particle at position $(r,\xi)$ in the bunch after travelling is given by the force exerted on the particle by the longitudinal electric field:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mathrm{d}U_p}{\mathrm{d}s}=-eE_z(r,\xi)
\end{equation}
where we have assumed that there occurs no modulation of the particle bunch as it traverses the plasma, hence the electric field is only a function of the position in the bunch $E_z(r,\xi)$ and not the propagation distance $s$. Integrating over the propagation distance then gives the energy of one particle in the beam at position $(r,\xi)$ after travelling a distance s:
\begin{equation}
U_e(r,\xi,s)=U_e(r,\xi,0)-seE_z(r,\xi)
\end{equation}
from which multiplication by the beam number density $n_b(r,\xi)$ and integration over the volume of the bunch gives the total energy of all particles in the bunch after propagation distance s
\begin{equation}
U(s)=\int  U_e(r,\xi,0)n_b(r,\xi)r\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\xi\mathrm{d}\phi-se\int E_z(r,\xi)n_b(r,\xi)r\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\xi\mathrm{d}\phi
\end{equation}
where $\mathrm{d}V=r\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\xi\mathrm{d}\phi$ [I think].
\subsection{Notes Bonatto}
Rate of change due to the longitudinal electric field acting on an electron beam, i.e position beam in the decelerating region of the wakefield.\\
"the beam only experiences its self-excited wakefield."\\
In the passive beam dump, are we essentially slowing down a "drive bunch" without having a witness bunch behind to get accelerated?\\
It is probaly better to use gamma as in Bonatto's paper, to make it easier to explain total beam energy integral. Basically integrate over all particles.\\
\\
$U=\gamma m_ec^2$
\begin{equation}
-\frac{\mathrm{d}U}{\mathrm{d}s}=(F_e)_z=eE_z
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the distance travelled in the plasma and $U$ is the energy of a particle in the beam at position $\xi$. 
for ultra relativistic beams, $\beta\sim 1$, the longitudinal electric field is a function of the position along the bunch $\xi=z-ct$ and not $z$ explicitly. 
\begin{equation}
U(s,\xi)=U_0-esE_z(\xi)
\end{equation}
The total energy of the beam after travelling a distance $s$ is then found by integrating across all the particles in the beam, which is integrating across $\xi$ since analysis is in 1-D.
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}(s)=U_0\int_{-\infty}
\end{equation}

We will proceed by calculating the gamma factor of a given particle in the beam who's energy we wish to compute.
\begin{equation}
\gamma(s,\xi)=\gamma_0-esE_z(\xi)
\end{equation}
