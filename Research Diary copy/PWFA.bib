abstract = {The validity and usefulness of linear wakefield theory for electron and positron bunches is investigated. Starting from the well-known Green's function for a cold-fluid plasma, engineering formulas for the maximum accelerating field for azimuthally symmetric bi-Gaussian beams of the form n b = n b e âˆ’ r 2 âˆ• 2 $\sigma$ r 2 e âˆ’ z 2 âˆ• 2 $\sigma$ z 2 are derived. It is also found that for fixed beam parameters the optimum wake is obtained for k p $\sigma$ z = 2 1 âˆ• 2 , for k p $\sigma$ r â©½ 1 . The validity and usefulness of linear-fluid theory is studied using fully nonlinear particle-in-cell simulations. It is found that linear theory can be useful beyond the nominal range of validity for narrow bunches. The limits of usefulness differ significantly between electron and positron bunches. For electron bunches, scaling laws are found for three limits for optimal plasma density ( k p $\sigma$ z = 2 1 âˆ• 2 ) , characterized by the normalized spot size k p $\sigma$ r and the normalized charge per unit length of the beam, $\Lambda$ â‰¡ ( n b âˆ• n p ) k p 2 $\sigma$ r 2 . These are $\epsilon$ â‰¡ e E âˆ• m c $\omega$ p = 1.3 ( n b âˆ• n p ) for k p $\sigma$ r {\textgreater} 1 and n b âˆ• n p {\textless} 1 , $\epsilon$ = 1.3 $\Lambda$ ln ( 1 âˆ• k p $\sigma$ r ) , for ( $\Lambda$ âˆ• 10 ) 1 âˆ• 2 {\textless} k p $\sigma$ r {\textless} 1 and $\Lambda$ {\textless} 1 , and $\epsilon$ = 1.3 $\Lambda$ ln ( [ 10 âˆ• $\Lambda$ ] 1 âˆ• 2 ) , for k p $\sigma$ r {\textless} ( $\Lambda$ âˆ• 10 ) 1 âˆ• 2 and $\Lambda$ {\textless} 1 . Linear theory breaks down for n b âˆ• n p â‰… 10 . On the other hand, for positron drivers linear-fluid theory breaks down for n b âˆ• n p â©¾ 1 independent of spot size.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Author(s). A plasma decelerating stage is investigated as a compact alternative for the disposal of high-energy beams (beam dumps). This could benefit the design of laser-driven plasma accelerator (LPA) applications that require transportability and / or high-repetition-rate operation regimes. Passive and laser-driven (active) plasma-based beam dumps are studied analytically and with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in a 1D geometry. Analytical estimates for the beam energy loss are compared to and extended by the PIC simulations, showing that with the proposed schemes a beam can be efficiently decelerated in a centimeter-scale distance.},

abstract = {Plasma-based decelerating schemes are investigated as compact alternatives for the disposal of high-energy beams(beam dumps). Analytical solutions for the energy loss of electron beams propagating in passive and active (laser-driven) schemes are derived. These solutions, along with numerical modeling, are used to investigate the evolution of the electron distribution, including energy chirp and total beam energy. In the active beam dump scheme, a laser-driver allows a more homogeneous beam energy extraction and drastically reduces the energy chirp observed in the passive scheme. These concepts could benefit applications requiring overall compactness, such as transportable light sources, or facilities operating at high beam power.},

abstract = {Few-fs electron bunches from laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) can efficiently drive plasma wakefields (PWFs), as shown by their propagation through underdense plasma in two experiments. A strong and density-insensitive deceleration of the bunches has been observed in 2 mm of 10 18 cm âˆ’3 density plasma with 5.1 GV=m average gradient, which is attributed to a self-driven PWF. This observation implies that the physics of PWFs, usually relying on large-scale rf accelerators as drivers, can be studied by tabletop LWFA electron sources.},

@article{Chou2016,
abstract = {This thesis covers several aspects related to Laser WakeField Acceleration (LWFA). A strong and ultrashort laser pulse can generate plasma waves with accelerating gradients up to 100s GV/m, four orders of magnitude higher than a conventional radio frequency linear accelerator. The LWFA electrons have been characterized as an ultra-short and high brilliance source. These remarkable properties lead to a compact accelerator which is of great scienti c interest for building a table-top coherent free electron laser as well as a single-shot electron di raction device. On the other hand, a new application of LWFA is to utilize the high peak current LWFA electron bunch to drive a wake eld eciently inside a high density underdense plasma. The resulting wake eld quickly decelerates the driver bunch or accelerates a properly designed witness bunch, and therefore the plasma is utilized as a compact beam dump or an afterburner staged after a regular LWFA. In the rst part of this work, the collective e ect driven by LWFA electron bunches was demonstrated. The Ti:Sapphire based 100 TW ATLAS laser system was used to drive LWFA. The target for electron generation included a 300 m diameter supersonic helium gas jet utilizing the so-called shock-front injection while a second 1.5 mm gas jet was used for electron deceleration. Thanks to the development of the shock-front injection, reproducible electron bunches were generated on a daily basis. The measurement has shown that the electron energy as well as the total bunch charge were dumped almost completely ({\textgreater}90{\%}) after insertion of the second jet. This e ect was observed even with several mm separation between the two jets. The observed peak deceleration gradient was 14 GV/m and 5.1 GV/m on average. We interpret the observation by the collective deceleration. A series of comprehensive simulations has been made to understand the physics of the process and showed a good agreement with experiment. The second part of this work focuses on the LWFA driven by LWS-20 laser system. LWS-20 delivers laser pulses of sub-2-cycle oscillations in electric eld and 70 mJ energy from which 40-50 mJ is on target. These pulses were focused within a supersonic helium jet with an exit diameter of 300 m. Such short pulses excite wake eld in the high density plasma ({\textgreater} 5  1019 cm?3) and are a unique tool to produce monoenergetic sub-10 MeV electrons. The corresponding high density plasma and precise control of the injection position of the shock front allowed us to retrieve the dephasing length and accelerating elds, which are two important parameters in LWFA but had never been measured precisely and directly. The experiments showed that the peak energy of the electron spectrum was tunable between 3 to 11 MeV and had an average energy spread 3.4 MeV; the total charge of the electron bunch was 1-3 pC. The density dependent dephasing length was determined to be in the 50-100 m range with a maximum accelerating eld of 100-200 GV/m. The dephasing length was in good agreement with theoretical predictions; however, the accelerating gradient deviated due to incomplete bubble structure evacuation. Our results provide a promising source for the application of single-shot electron di raction.},

@article{Hanahoe2017,
abstract = {A plasma beam dump uses the collective oscillations of plasma electrons to absorb the kinetic energy of a particle beam. In this paper, a modified passive plasma beam dump scheme is proposed using either a gradient or stepped plasma profile to maintain a higher decelerating gradient compared with a uniform plasma. The improvement is a result of the plasma wavelength change preventing the re-acceleration of low energy particles. Particle-in-cell simulation results show that both stepped and gradient plasma profiles can achieve improved energy loss compared with a uniform plasma for an electron bunch of parameters routinely achieved in laser wakefield acceleration.},

@article{Wu2010,
abstract = {With the increasing development of laser electron accelerators, electron energies beyond a GeV have been reached and higher values are expected in the near future. A conventional beam dump based on ionization or radiation loss mechanisms is cumbersome and costly, not to mention the radiological hazards. We revisit the stopping power theory of high-energy charged particles in matter and discuss the associated problem of beam dumping from the point of view of collective deceleration. The collective stopping length in an ionized gas can be several orders of magnitude shorter than that described by the Bethe-Bloch formulas and associated with multiple electromagnetic cascades in solids. At the same time, the tenuous density of the gas makes the radioactivation negligible. Such a compact beam dump without radioactivation works well for short and dense bunches, as they are typically generated from a laser wakefield accelerator. In addition, the nonuniform transverse wakefield can induce microbunching of the electron bunch by betatron oscillation. The microstructure could serve as a prebunched source for coherent radiation or feeding a free electron laser.},
